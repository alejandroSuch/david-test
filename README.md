## Occurrences problem

Write a TypeScript function that takes in 2 string parameters, `str1` and `str2`, and returns the number of times `str2` occurs as a substring inside `str1`. Make sure tests go green.

ex: str1=”cat in a hat” and str2=”at” then function returns 2.

Please check the tests for more examples.
